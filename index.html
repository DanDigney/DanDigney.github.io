	<h1>Carl Sagan</h1>
	<p>Hello! This little site is dedicated to a very brief summary of the Brooklyn born Astronomer, Carl Sagan.</p>

	<h2>Life</h2>
	<p>Sagan was born November 9th, 1934, living primarily in Brooklyn. In 1948, the same year that Sagan entered high school, his family moved to Rahway, New Jersey, he would graduate in 1951.</p>
	<p>Many of Sagan's teachers believed he had a gift, with his administrator going as far as to say, <q>This kid ought to go to a school for gifted children, he has something really remarkable.</q> Although unable to do so, Sagan did manage to avoid boredom by constructing cardboard cutouts to help himself visualize molecules.</p>

		"Imagine, a room, awash in gasoline. And there are two implacable enemies in that room. One of them has 9,000 matches. The other has 7,000 matches. Each of them is concerned about who's ahead, who's stronger. Well, that's the kind of situation we are actually in. The amount of weapons that are available to the United States and the Soviet Union are so bloated, so grossly in excess of what's needed to dissuade the other that if it weren't so tragic, it would be laughable." -- Carl Sagan, Remarks on the nuclear arms race, November 20th, 1983.
